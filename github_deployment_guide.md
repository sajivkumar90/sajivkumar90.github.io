## Deploying Your Personal Brand Website to GitHub Pages

This guide provides detailed steps for deploying your website to GitHub Pages and managing it after deployment.

### Deployment Process

#### After Setting Up Your Repository

Once you've created your repository and uploaded your files following the setup instructions:

1. **Wait for Initial Deployment**
   - GitHub Pages typically takes 1-5 minutes to build and deploy your site
   - You can check the status in the "Actions" tab of your repository

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Visit https://sajivkumar90.github.io to confirm your site is live
   - Check that all sections and styling appear correctly
   - Test the navigation menu and any interactive elements

3. **Update Repository Settings (Optional)**
   - In repository Settings > Pages, you can enable "Enforce HTTPS" for added security
   - You can also set up a custom 404 page if desired

### Making Updates to Your Website

#### Simple Text Changes

1. Navigate to your repository (github.com/sajivkumar90/sajivkumar90.github.io)
2. Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., index.html)
3. Click the pencil icon to edit the file
4. Make your changes
5. Scroll down and add a commit message describing your changes
6. Click "Commit changes"
7. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update your site

   - Verify GitHub Pages is still enabled in Settings

2. **Styling Issues**
